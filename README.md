# Blockchain-Solidity-Learning-Stage-1 with Hardhat

This will be the storage space for my first solidity project through my learning with Dapp University, Feedtheblock, and freecodecamp.org.

# Hardhat Section

This is the code location for the part of the tutorial of
[Ultimate Solidity Tutorial: DeFi, Flash Loans, Hacking, NFTs & more!](https://youtu.be/eoQJ6nFZOcs) that focuses on testing smart contracts with hardhat. The completed code from Dapp University can be found [here](https://github.com/dappuniversity/solidity_tutorial).

# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
